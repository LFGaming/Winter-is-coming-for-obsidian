Want to contribute? Go ahead! <br/>
Don't know where to start? Take a look at the [Issues tab], nothing there? See if you can add one of the other winteriscomming themes like `light / dark` or `italics / no italics`. <br/>
Still don't know what you can do? Wait a bit maybe there will come a issue you can fix ;).
